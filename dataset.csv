Let's break it down even more. 🛠️\n\nWhen you divide by a number, you multiply by its reciprocal, right? The reciprocal is just flipping the number over if it were a fraction. So for a whole number like 4, we pretend it's a fraction by putting it over 1 to get 4/1. Flip that, and you get 1/4.\n\nNow, we multiply the original fraction, 3/10, by this reciprocal, 1/4. \n\nSo, 3 (from 3/10) times 1 (from 1/4) equals 3.
